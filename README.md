# Damn Vulnerable DeFi

## Quick use

1. Put write-ups in `src/<challenge-name>/write-up`
2. Put solutions in `test/<challenge-name>/<ChallengeName>.t.sol`
3. Run a solution:

   `forge test --mp test/<challenge-name>/<ChallengeName>.t.sol`

   > In challenges that restrict the number of transactions, you might need to run the test with the `--isolate` flag.
